* Players take turns to move a piece of their own colour
* Pieces can only move diagonally, and initially only forwards.

* Any piece that reaches the far edge of the board is `crowned` and is refered to as a `king`
* Kings can move forwards and backwards.

* If the piece is adjacent to an oponents piece, and there is a space behind it, the oppontents piece can be `captured`
* A player captures a piece by hopping over it into the space behind.
* If a player can `capture` a piece, they must do so.
* If, upon capturing a piece, another piece can be captured, they must also capture any subsequent pieces.

* If more than one piece can capture, the player chooses.
